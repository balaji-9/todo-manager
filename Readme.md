A to-do manager is a software application designed to help users keep track of tasks and manage their time more effectively. This to-do manager allows users to easily add new to-do items, mark them as complete, and categorize them based on their due dates. 

The system displays four categories: "Due Today", "Due Later", "Overdue", and "Completed Items" to help users prioritize their tasks and stay on top of their deadlines. With this to-do manager, users can manage their to-do list efficiently and increase their productivity by keeping track of their tasks in one place.
